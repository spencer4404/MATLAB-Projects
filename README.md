# Collection of all the MATLAB excersizes and projects I worked on during the Fall 2024 semester

8 excersizes and 2 bigger projects

Excersize 1: Find final velocities of two carts that collide elastically then check the conservation of momentum and energy

Excersize 2: Turning excersize 1 into a design problem where the user can enter what they want and calculate the mass of cart 2 that will make it stop on impact based on the given details about cart 1

Excersize 3: Computing velocities of 3 carts after they have collided and deciding how many collisions there are

Excersize 4: Consits of plotting 4 different functions: truncated power series, a shifted sinusoid, a normalized gaussian curve, and three dampings for a parallel RLC circuit

Excersize 5: Showing that the product of two sinusoids can be written as the sum of two sinusoids

Excersize 6: Taking exercise 3 and allowing for user input

Excersize 7: Plotting overlayed voltage, current, and power absorbed for a charging inductor

Excersize 8: Finding coefficients for use in partial fraction expansion



Project 1: Power series expansion of Acos(wt)

Project 2: Calculating force and plotting distance on a baseball after it was hit
